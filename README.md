# password-generator
## A fun way to generate a random password, because all your passwords have been leaked

## SUMMARY

My main goal was to build a password generator that follows certain parameters.
These include a random special character, numbers and a mix of lower and upper case characters. The password cannot exceed 128 characters while having to be a minimum of 8 characters.
From a developer perspective, I aimed to create clear and concise code that could easily be refactored in future.

I returned to this project as I have gained a better understanding of Dev Ops. I broke down the project into managable tasks and successully created a MVP. 
Moving forward, the code could do with some futher refactoring in order to ensure it is DRY.



## INSTALLATION

Application has been re-deployed successfully, using Netlify. Please access site at:

Stages in code refactor can be found via GitHub:

## USAGE

This password generator serves as a way to see how functions, for loops and arrays can work together in code. 
A wonderful way to gain a random password
