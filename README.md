# password-generator
## A fun way to generate a random password, because all your passwords have been leaked

## SUMMARY

My main goal was to build a password generator that follows certain parameters.
These include a random special character, nubers and a mix of lower and upper case characters. The password cannot exceed 128 characters.
From a developer perspective, I aimed to create clear and concise code that could easily be refactored in future.
Moving forward, a lot more work needs to be put into the functions in this code as values were not returning most likely due to a miss match of variables and scope. This in turn discouraged me to create the remaining sections. 
This requires future refactoring.



## INSTALLATION

Application has been deployed successfully. Please access site at:

Stages in code refactor can be found via GitHub:

## USAGE

This password generator serves as a way to see how functions, for loops and arrays can work togetherin code.
